WITH pizzas_sold AS (
  SELECT pizza_id, COUNT(*) AS pizza_sold, cancellation
  FROM t_customer_orders
  LEFT JOIN t_runner_orders ON t_customer_orders.order_id = t_runner_orders.order_id
  GROUP BY pizza_id, cancellation)
SELECT SUM(CASE
        WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12*pizza_sold
        WHEN pizza_id = 2 THEN 10*pizza_sold
        END) AS total_sold
FROM pizzas_sold
WHERE cancellation = '';
