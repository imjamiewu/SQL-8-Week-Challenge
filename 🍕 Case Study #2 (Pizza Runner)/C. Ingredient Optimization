--4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:

--5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.
-- SELECT *
-- FROM t_customer_orders;

--6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?
